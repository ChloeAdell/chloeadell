	  <p> <h3>Reflection</h3> During my time at SECHS, several experiences have contributed to my growth, development, and success. One of the most important factors has been the dual enrollment opportunity with Lone Star College. Taking college-level courses while still in high school taught me how to manage my time effectively and pushed me to become more independent and self-motivated. The academic challenges I faced in classes like General Chemistry II,  encouraged me to develop strong study habits and to seek help when needed, whether from teachers, tutors, or peers. The support I received from SECHS staff, who genuinely care about student success, also played a big role in keeping me on track. Another major influence was my involvement in extracurricular activities, where I learned teamwork, leadership, and communication skills. Working on group projects taught me how to collaborate with others and value different perspectives. I've also learned to advocate for myself and take responsibility for my learning. Facing personal challenges during my time at SECHS helped me build resilience and emotional strength. Iâ€™ve grown not just academically but as a person who is more goal-driven, and adaptable. These experiences have helped shape my mindset and prepared me for what lies ahead.
After high school, I plan to achieve several goals as part of my post-secondary plan. One of my main goals is to build strong study habits in college by studying in the library with others and forming a study group. I believe having a supportive group of peers will keep me motivated and help me stay on top of challenging coursework. I also want to explore new interests by joining academic clubs, tech organizations, or cultural groups that align with my identity and passions. Another goal is to pursue internships and research opportunities that will help me grow professionally and gain real-world experience. Most importantly, I want to maintain a balanced lifestyle, taking care of my mental health while striving for academic excellence. These goals will help me stay grounded and focused as I work toward earning my degree and building a meaningful career.
