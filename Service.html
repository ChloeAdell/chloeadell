<h3> Reflection</h3>
    <p>My experiences with these roles have greatly shaped my personal and professional growth. At STEMBridges Houston, managing social media and outreach honed my communication skills and taught me the importance of creating community connections. At River Pines Elementary, I cherished mentoring students, watching their reading and writing progress, and learning the value of adaptability while juggling multiple responsibilities like organizing the library and running the student store. As a tour guide at Jesse Jones Park, I developed my ability to engage and educate diverse audiences, while my role at Woodland Hills Elementary sharpened my attention to detail and teamwork skills. These experiences collectively taught me the importance of service, leadership, and creating meaningful connections.</p>
