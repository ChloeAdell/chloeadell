    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      Entering high school as a confused and scared freshman, the only confidence I held was in my academics, and that became my sole focus. I maintained an A in all my classes, even while coping with the loss of my grandmother during finals week. However, as I began to engage in community service, I learned the importance of caring for others beyond myself. I started by volunteering at an elementary school, which helped me understand what it means to be a leader. I took my responsibility for shaping young minds very seriously. As the years went by, I transitioned to different service sites, but my core thoughts and values remained intact. As I transition through the grades. Now as a Senior, I take pride in the growth I have achieved in each area and especially in academics as I currently still have a 4.0.
